Code Examples
A few simple code examples in various project types.  The samples are very simple as I am a bit limited on time.  

The following projects are included:
Angular (.net core)
Asp.net MVC
WPF
WebAPI
Database
Basic Unit Tests
Data Models (Core)
Repository Pattern (Base)

I follow fairly natural naming conventions, I expect the solution should be relatively easy to navigate.

All of the projects were created using VS 2019 Community edition.

I did not include a seed script in the database project, the database is Adventure Works for 2017.
